The VX1 plugin is more than just an equalizer, a compressor, a delay, and a reverb. It is a vocal enhancer that lets you choose from different presets and contours that suit your vocal style and genre. You can also adjust the sensitivity, output, compress, FX, delay mix, decay, and verb tone to fine-tune your sound. The VX1 plugin can help you squeeze more emotion from a subtle performance, or get the vocal to sit just right in a large production.
     
Here are some of the features and benefits of the VX1 plugin:

- It has three different contours that select between the three most used reverbs in pop and disco styles: C1 is a medium general purpose reverb, C2 is a long reverb appropriate for ballads, and C3 is a tight room able to place the vocal in your face. Each contour adjusts the delay time according to the selected reverb style, but you can also modify it with the DLY control.
- It has two EQ bands specially designed to bring clarity and presence to a track that has not been previously processed. Both bands are very effective, and they can even create telephone effects by placing both in the minimum. In the contour 3 mode, the compress knob is replaced by a third EQ band: AIR, which is responsible for adding the sound universally known as "expensive" and which is recurrent in energetic styles such as EDM and rap.
- It has a compress knob that allows you to increase or decrease the original compression amount for each preset, assuming that the sensitivity has been adjusted correctly. The sensitivity knob lets you set the input level so that the compressor works properly. The output knob lets you match the output volume with the bypass volume.
- It has an FX knob that controls the signal level sent to the effects section, which includes the reverb and the delay. You can also adjust or mute the delay later with the DLY MIX knob. To listen to the effects section in isolation, you can select the SEND mode. This mode is designed to use the effects of VX1 in parallel, but it is also an excellent opportunity for fine tuning.
- It has a DECAY knob that allows you to further adjust the reverb time within the selected style. It also has a VRB TONE knob that is a tone control applied to the reverb. You can try to find a tone completely contrasting with that of the original signal to create interesting effects.
